General User Interface Metaphor

## Summary

It provides a single metaphor for interacting with computers that's simple enough to teach to children yet provides facilities that are useful to programmers. It integrates all levels of software from the desktop to assembly language.

There are three basic user-facing elements to a Xerblin system.

*    Stack - a place to put objects for user manipulation. This is similar to a Clipboard but it can hold more than one item at a time. Commands operate on the items on the Stack.
*    Dictionary - a place to keep commands. Any command that is inscribed in the Dictionary can be run from the user interface.
*    Interpreter - A very simple command interpreter that takes care of running commands with the Stack.

In addition to the above three UI elements there are discrete commands that provide the basic functionality of the system and that can be composed into more complex commands. They live in the Dictionary and act upon the Stack. They can be composed into compound commands using three primal relations:

*    Sequence - do one thing after another.
*    Loop - do something over again.
*    Branch - do one thing or another.

Using the above three relations compound commands can be composed to perform more involved tasks using the built-in or user-provided "primitives" and other compound commands.  Composition can be done by program, by command line, in the GUI using the mouse and keyboard, or by means of parsing languages.

With a rich set of basic commands and the three kinds of compound commands you have a completely general computer interface that allows for customization and flexibility and can be easily understood and mastered by the average user.


## Installation

I use virtualenv and pip on an Ubuntu Linux system and installation from GitHub is straightforward:


    sforman@callix:~$ git clone git@github.com:PhoenixBureau/Xerblin.git
    sforman@callix:~$ virtualenv virt-env
    sforman@callix:~$ source ./virt-env/bin/activate
    (virt-env)sforman@callix:~$ cd Xerblin/
    (virt-env)sforman@callix:~/Xerblin$ pip install -r requirements.txt

    ...snip...

    Successfully installed Flask dulwich Werkzeug Jinja2
    Cleaning up...
    (virt-env)sforman@callix:~/Xerblin$ python main.py
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
     * Restarting with reloader


Or, if you prefer all the commands by themselves in a script:

    git clone git@github.com:PhoenixBureau/Xerblin.git
    virtualenv virt-env
    source ./virt-env/bin/activate
    cd Xerblin/
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py


### Three Xerblins

There are *two* entry points to the server, `main.py` which runs a Xerblin interpreter in the server but does _not_ store the history to disk, and `run.py` which _does_ store history to disk and uses the Dulwich git library to store the history in a git repository.

If you start either version a Flask server is created that serves two versions of a webpage that contains an interface to a Xerblin interpreter

*  The "root" URL ('/') serves a self-contained webpage (dependencies are loaded from a CDN) that has the interpreter in Javascript.  You can save this page and edit it to play with a one-page web-based Xerblin.
* The `/foo` URL serves a varient of the same page that connects (with AJAX) to the server-based Python Xerblin interpreter, which allows the webpage to serve as an interface to it.


<table>
    <thead>
        <td></td><td> /foo </td><td> / </td>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>main.py</td><td>Server-Side Python</td><td>In-Browser Javascript</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>run.py</td><td>Server-Side Python with Git History</td><td>In-Browser Javascript</td>
    </tr>
</table>


If you use the `run.py` entry point you can tell it which directory to use. The _first_ time you run the server with the git history store you must use the `--init` switch, after that you must leave it off. (I know that's a little clumsy, I may change it in the future.)

Here is the output of the `-h` switch which shows the command line options for the `run.py` server entry point:

    usage: run.py [-h] [-r ROOST] [-i]
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -r ROOST, --roost ROOST
                            Use this directory as home for the Pigeon system.
                            (default: $HOME/.pigeon). (I apologize for the
                            terrible pun.)
      -i, --init            Initialize the "roost" directory with git repo and
                            system.pickle.


Run it once the first time with the `--init` option, after that you leave it off.  It starts a Flask server and you can open a browser window and interact with it.  If you use the same "roost" directory it will reload the last saved state when you restart the server.  Each time you issue a command to the interpreter it will save the state (this is per command line, not per command _in_ the command line.)

Basically this gives you an on-disk persistent data structure that captures the entire history of your interaction with the interpreter.  Soon I will implement ways to "cherry pick" data and commands from past history so you can build new interpreter state that contains just the data and commands you want for a particular task.

In effect the persistent Xerblin interpreter provides a programmable UI that the average person can quickly and easily learn to use.  Then it provides (potentially) a web-publishable history that can be shared and used as a resource.


### Basic Interpreter Usage

The interpreter is very simple.  To use it you type in the entry box and hit return or click the "interpret" button.  The text you typed is split on spaces and then evaluated word-by-word.

*  Numbers such as `23` and `88.8` are put on the stack as numerical values (`int` and `float` object in Python, and whatever JS uses in JS.)
*  Any text that starts and ends with double quote marks `"` and contains no spaces is put onto the stack as a string (the quotes are stripped.)
*  Words that aren't numbers or text strings are looked up in the dictionary of commands and then executed.  If a word isn't found or fails the entire command line fails and the interpreter does not change state.

You can create new commands by combining existing commands. I posted [a video on Youtube that shows this process][video_demo].  In the video I create two new commands: `sqr` which squares the number on the stack, and `dropall` which "drops" all the items from the stack clearing it for further use.

I am creating more documentation, but in the meantime, here are some more resources.

### Some links:

*   The [old project on Google Code][a]. This is still the reference implementation.
*   [Pigeon Computer][b] is a project I have to develop a simple system to teach computer programing. It includes both a low-level version in assembly language and a high-level version in Python with a Tkinter GUI.

### Historical Info

Way back in the day, over a decade ago, the original source for what became "xerblin" was a book ["System Design from Provably Correct Constructs"][c] by [Dr. James Martin][d] [founder, Oxford Martin School][e] ([personal website][f]).

I need to expand on each of these eventually.
