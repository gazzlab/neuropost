Use the provided version of Virtualenv (in the third-party dir) to
install Pip and then the requirements:

    $ tar xzf third-party/virtualenv-1.9rc1.tar.gz -C third-party/
    $ ./third-party/virtualenv-1.9rc1/virtualenv.py virt-env
    $ source ./virt-env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You also need to create a file called "sooper_sekrit.py" and define a
single variable "secret" that contains the random "app secret" for
creating sessions.
